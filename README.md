# BioLogin
The repository for a biometric system where users can register and log in using their photos.

# Setup
Make sure to have downloaded python 3.11.9!

Create a virtual environment with the Python3.11.9 interpreter:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv verification_env
```

Activate it:
```bash
source verification_env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the app
Once the setup is completed open two different terminals.

Run the back-end part by running:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

Run the front-end part by navigating in the "photo-capture" directory and running
```bash
npm start
```

And now interact with the environment!
